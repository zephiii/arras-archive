        <li>Undid a change to targeting that caused lots of issues in terms of lag!</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where mobile users couldn't respawn due to the protocol kicking them for good!</li>
        <li>Hopefully, we will be slowing down updates a tad so we don't have more than one update a day!</li>
